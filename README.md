# DAR-Monitoring System  
🚀 *A web-based monitoring system for the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR), improving data management efficiency.*  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project was developed to address inefficiencies in DAR's data management system. The department primarily relied on Microsoft Office applications, limiting collaboration and accessibility. To solve this, we built a **web-based system using CodeIgniter**, improving data tracking, reporting, and access control.  

### 🔹 Key Challenge: Managing 3,000+ Landowner Records  
One of the biggest challenges was **handling and structuring over 3,000+ landowner records**, ensuring:  
- **Efficient storage** with an optimized MySQL database  
- **Fast data retrieval** through indexed queries  
- **Scalability** for future data expansion
