# DAR-Monitoring System
🚀 A web-based monitoring system for the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR), improving data management efficiency.

📌 Project Overview
This project was developed to address inefficiencies in DAR's data management system. The department primarily relied on Microsoft Office applications, limiting collaboration and accessibility. To solve this, we built a web-based system using CodeIgniter, improving data tracking, reporting, and access control.

One of the biggest challenges was handling and structuring over 3,000+ landowner records, ensuring efficient storage, retrieval, and performance optimization.

🏗 Tech Stack
Backend: CodeIgniter (PHP), MySQL
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Other Tools: Bootstrap, jQuery
🔥 Challenges & Solutions
✅ Learning Curve – No prior experience with CodeIgniter, but quickly adapted and implemented best practices.
✅ Data Structuring – Designed an efficient database schema to manage and query 3,000+ landowner records without performance issues.
✅ Scalability – Optimized queries and indexing to ensure fast data retrieval and report generation.
✅ Real-World Constraints – Developed the system within the department’s technical limitations while ensuring long-term usability.

📊 Key Features
✔️ Secure user authentication & access control
✔️ Dynamic report generation for monitoring progress
✔️ Automated data validation to minimize human errors
✔️ Efficient database management for 3,000+ landowner records
