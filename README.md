# DAR-Monitoring System
🚀 A web-based monitoring system for the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR), improving data management efficiency.

📌 Project Overview
This project was developed to address the inefficiencies in DAR's data management system. The department primarily relied on Microsoft Office applications, limiting collaboration and accessibility. To solve this, we built a web-based system using CodeIgniter, improving data tracking, reporting, and access control.

🏗 Tech Stack
Backend: CodeIgniter (PHP), MySQL
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Other Tools: Bootstrap, jQuery
🔥 Challenges & Solutions
✅ Learning Curve – No prior experience with CodeIgniter, but quickly adapted and implemented best practices.
✅ Data Structuring – Designed an efficient database schema to handle large sets of agrarian reform data.
✅ Real-World Constraints – Developed the system within the department’s technical limitations while ensuring scalability.

📊 Key Features
✔️ Secure user authentication & access control
✔️ Dynamic report generation for monitoring progress
✔️ Automated data validation to minimize human errors

🎯 What I Learned
Framework Adaptability: Self-learned CodeIgniter and built a fully functional system.
Problem-Solving: Transformed an inefficient manual process into a digital solution.
Collaboration: Worked closely with my IT partner and department stakeholders.
